Recipe for original traditional bavarian cheesenoodles (Allgäuer Käsespätzle)

Ingridients for 2 people, multiple if needed

200g Flower
3 Eggs
2 Teespoons Salt
2 sorts of cheese (edamer and an older more tasty cow cheese)
1 Onion

Stir together, add about 1/8l water in zips. Keep stirig till dough is stiff sticky or paste like. Add flower if too inviscid, add water if the dough is not strong.

Boil water.

Cut the onion into thin slices. Cook them in a pan with butter till they are glazy and a little brown. 

Use a spaetzle lid to rub the dough into the boiling water. The spatzle lid will portion them into small drops. 
Reduce the heat on the stove. The noodle drops get done rather quick and foam. When they are ready they start rising in the water.
Use a dipper to scum the noodles into a bowl. We will now layer the noodles and the cheese. Add some butter, the cheese. Put more noodeles over this layer. Some butter and cheese again, use the rest of the noodles.

Use two spoons to fold in the layers. The cheese will now string.
Add the fried onion rings on top. Ready to serve.

Caution!! Do not use hot water to afterwards clean your dough bowl or the spaetzle lid or the dough will harden and get off really bad. Use cold water to wash things off. 

Enjoy!!
